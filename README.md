# **Greetings!**

My name Liam Povey, but online I am known as **Th3Nihilist**. I am the author of the book *Navigating The Abyss* (currently unpublished), and the head of The Cosmopolitan Project. My Discord server, FaithlessReborn, can be found -here-(link coming soon). You can find my podcast, The Nihilist's Compass, on Spotify and subscribe early before I begin dropping episodes. My linktree is found [here](linktr.ee/th3nihilist), which has links to my socials.

I enjoy coding, and I am a student of programming. My passions are tech and ethics, and I soon hope to manage my own business which encompasses the things previously discussed. I'm currently learning Python and Linux Fundamentals in preparation for this year's BPA compatitions. I participate in High School Varsity Football, Varsity Quiz Bowl, Varsity Track and Field, and BPA.

You can reach me at liam26povey@gmail.com, or my Discord Server.
